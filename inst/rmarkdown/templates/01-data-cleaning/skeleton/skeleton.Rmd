## Introduction

### Purpose

This notebook presents the results of initial exploratory analysis designed to support decision-making around data cleaning. Use it to explore the data produced by the `load_data` function and record cleaning decisions. These cleaning decisions will be formalized in the `clean_data` function. 

Important questions to answer include: 

- Samples: which sets of records will be used in the analysis? 
- Joins: where are you combining data from different datasets and why?
- Filters: if any records are dropped from the raw data, why? What impact does each filter have on the sample size? 
- Transformations: if any new variables are created, or raw variables are transformed in any way, how and why? 
- Selections: which variables will be included in the final analysis dataset(s)

Support your decisions with analysis where appropriate. 

### Load data


```{r load-data}
dat <- load_data(use_cache = TRUE)
```

### Summary of decisions

Summarize your decisions here, with a special focus on the samples.
